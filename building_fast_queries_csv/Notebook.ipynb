    "\n",
    "Let's take a logical approach to understanding this. Let's say we were searching for an id that was the very last row. So our for loop will have to look through every row till it reaches the last row to get a result. So if we have N lines, it would take us N time to get a result. (the unit of time is not important, rather to understand at what rate the time to get a result will change if the data changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you might argue that is not true for every id. One id might be at the very first row, one in the middle and so on. That is true, but we as data engineers focus on the worst case possible. That way you are prepared for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it this way, you don't need to pay all this money for fire insurance. You are careful and what are the odds right?. We still get it because we assume that the worst case can happen. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we know the worst case. Now how do we prepare for it. Is there a better method to search for an id? Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you have a a huge shelf. You classify each space using labels. So a label for ketchup, a label for mustard and a label for drinks. Now anyone searching for a product can easily find where it is based on the labels instead of individually checking each space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this idea of labels sound familiar. The concept is similar to dictionaries. Dictionaries have much faster lookups than list. Now the the reason as to why can get complex. A simple explanation is the way dictionaries are built. Each key in the dictionary has to be unique and immutable (cannot be changed). Lists on the other hand are mutable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our example, if you didn't have labels on your shelf, then ketchup can be anywhere. Even if you find it in the first try, you still have to look through the entire shelf to make sure there is not more than one. But with labels, we know ketchup can only and only go in its corresponding label. There is no way it will be anywhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know our laptop_id's are unique, hence we can easily make the id's as key in our dictionary. You might be wondering why not use sets. Elements in a set have to be unique and immutable too. Yes, we would use sets if we only wanted to check if we had a particular id in stock. But we also need other information about the laptop (which remember is not unique. you can have more than one apple products.)\n",

O(N) can be interpreted as processing time will increase proportionally with data. O(N^2) known as quadratic time complexity, tells us that processing time will quadruple if the size of the data doubled. So even without running the data you can already tell that such an algorithm will not be very useful in our business setting.\n",

    "That way we can use a language such as sql and query varying questions regarding all sorts of data. Not only is the language much easier to work with, most databases come with built in mechanisms under the hood to make queries run faster.\n",
